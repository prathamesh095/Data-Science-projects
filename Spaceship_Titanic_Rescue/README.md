## Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/prathamesh095/Data-Science-projects/tree/main/Spaceship_Titanic_Rescue>
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Spaceship_Titanic_Rescue
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Spaceship_Titanic_Rescue.ipynb
    ```

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- plotly
- matplotlib

Ensure that you have the required libraries installed by running the above command to install dependencies.

## Dataset

Place the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files in the `data` directory.

## Results

The final predictions are stored in `sample_submission.csv`. The `DecisionTreeClassifier` model was chosen for the final predictions based on its performance.
