## Overview

This project aims to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during the maiden voyage of the Spaceship Titanic. The prediction model is built using several classification algorithms, and the best performing model is used for the final predictions.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/prathamesh095/Data-Science-projects/tree/main/spaceship>
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    cd Spaceship_Titanic_Rescue
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- plotly
- matplotlib

Ensure that you have the required libraries installed by running the above command to install dependencies.

## Dataset

Place the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files in the `data` directory.

## Results

The final predictions are stored in `sample_submission.csv`. The `DecisionTreeClassifier` model was chosen for the final predictions based on its performance.
